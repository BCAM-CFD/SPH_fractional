---------------------------- DESCRIPTION ------------------------

 Code for simulating fluids using the SPH integral viscoelastic method.
 A fractional model for the constitutive equation has been implemented.

 This code is  based on the original MCF code  developed by Xin Bian.
 The  current version  has  been developed  in collaboration  between
 - Marco Ellero,  leader of the  CFD Modelling and Simulation  group at
    BCAM (Basque Center  for Applied Mathematics) in  Bilbao, Spain.
 - Luca Santelli, member of  the  CFD Modelling and Simulation  group at

-------------------------- INSTALLATION -------------------------------

After download MCF/mcf/ folder,
I suppose you have already installed PPM library
in a proper path,
which needs to be given when you configure mcf client.
I also suppose you have installed makedepf90,
which is to check routines dependency of mcf/src/*.F90.

1) run script
 
  ./clean.sh

to clean all old files, which may be machine dependant.

2) run script

  ./bootstrap.sh

to make use of GNU autoconf + automake,
which generates configure script.

3) run configuration.

./configure --prefix=$HOME/MCF/mcf/mcf_install/ FC=ifort MPIFC=mpif90 LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/MCF/ppm/local/lib/ FCFLAGS=-I$HOME/MCF/ppm/local/include/ MAKEDEPF90=$HOME/MCF/ppm/local/bin/makedepf90

to generate Makefile, which is used to compile mcf code.

LDFLAGS: indicate ppm library object files.
FCFLAGS: indicate ppm library header files.


4) run compiler

  make -j 8

to compile mcf code,
-j 8 specify to use 8 processors to accelerate compiling.

5) run installation

  make install

to install mcf executable binary at ...../mcf/mcf_install/ folder.

-------------- USE -----------------------------------------------

Three input files are required to launch a simulation. Examples of
these input files can be found in the 'mcf_config' directory. The
details of the inputs are explained within those files.
