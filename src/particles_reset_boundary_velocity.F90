        !               walls' velocity.

        !               A For periodic boundary particles,
        !               we do nothing.

        !               B Symmetry, Wall using symmetry or
        !               Lees-Edwards boundary.

        !               For symmetry boundary particles, 
        !               wall using symmetry/mirror boundary
        !               particles, or Lees-Edwards boundary 
        !               paritcles, they are all created by
        !               PPM. They are outside of physical 
        !               domain and all of them are treated
        !               completely as ghost particles, we 
        !               don't need to integrate their 
        !               position at all. Therefore,
        !               We do nothing for their velocities.
        !
        !               C  Wall boundary using solid 
        !               particles.
        !
        !               Since solid wall are modeled using 
        !               solid particles inside the total 
        !               physical domain, i.e., there is no
        !               relative motion among solid wall 
        !               boundary particles if they are
        !               inside the same wall and PPM treat
        !               the solid wall particles as inside
        !               physical domain.
        !
        !               Moreover, the solid wall boundary 
        !               particles are created by client
        !               MCF, thus we have to integrate 
        !               their positions every step.
        !
        !               However, during the force calculation,
        !               the solid wall boundary particles 
        !               could have been given artificial 
        !               velocities (if Morris et al. 1997 
        !               noslip is used) to ensure noslip on 
        !               the wall, therefore here we have to 
        !               assign them with the real velocities
        !               of walls again.
